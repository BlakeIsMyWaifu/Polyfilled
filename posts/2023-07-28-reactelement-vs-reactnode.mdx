## Short Summary

- `JSX.Element` and `React.ReactElement` are (almost) the exact same thing.
- `React.ReactElement` represents a single component or an HTML element.
- `React.ReactNode` represents anything that can be put into the virtual DOM.
- Use `React.ReactNode` when typing props and return types

```tsx
const ExampleElement = () => {
  return <div>Hello World</div>
  //     ^ This is a ReactElement
}

const ExampleNode = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Title</h1>
      <ExampleElement />
    </div>
  )
  // ^ This is a ReactNode
}
```

## Complete Explanation

For simplicity from now on we won't include the React namespace meaning `React.ReactElement` will become `ReactElement`.

### What is an Element in JSX

For better or for worse, JSX isn't inbuilt into regular JavaScript.
JSX is just sematic sugar that has to be transpiled into JavaScript so that our browsers can interpret.
A JSX Element, much like everything else in JavaScript, is an object.

```ts
const testElement = React.createElement('div', { test: 'props' }, 'Inner Text')

console.log(testElement)

const logOutput = {
  $$typeof: [object Symbol] { ... },
  _owner: null,
  _store: { ... },
  key: null,
  props: {
    children: 'Inner Text',
    test: 'props'
  },
  ref: null,
  type: 'div'
}
```

When we use either the `JSX.Element` or `ReactElement` type, it represents a single HTML Element.
It is the building blocks of JSX and React.

### Differences between JSX.Element and ReactElement

First we'll look at the type definition of a `ReactElement` which can be found in the [DefinitelyTyped package](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react/index.d.ts#L163)
```ts
interface ReactElement<
  P = any,
  T extends string | JSXElementConstructor<any> = string | JSXElementConstructor<any>
> {
  type: T;
  props: P;
  key: Key | null;
}
```

Now we'll look at the definition of a `JSX.Element`.
```ts
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface Element extends React.ReactElement<any, any> { }
  }
}
```

The key difference is `ReactElement` takes two generic arguments whereas `JSX.Element` doesn't take any so they'll always be `any`.
```ts
type TestJSX = JSX.Element<{test: string}>; // ! error
type TestREACT = React.ReactElement<{test: string}>; // works fine
```

### What is a ReactNode

A `ReactNode` is everything that React can render.
Once again we can look at the type definition in the [DefinitelyTyped package](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/b23a36e669fa127d1035e22ca93faab85b98e49f/types/react/index.d.ts#L263)
```ts
declare namespace React {
  type ReactNode =
    | ReactElement
    | string
    | number
    | Iterable<ReactNode>
    | ReactPortal
    | boolean
    | null
    | undefined
    | DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED_EXPERIMENTAL_REACT_NODES[keyof DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED_EXPERIMENTAL_REACT_NODES];
}
```
`ReactNode` is a union type of lots of different types, one of which being `ReactElement`.
`Iterable<ReactNode>` is better known as `ReactFragment` which lets you group children without effecting the DOM.
It should go without saying that the last type can be safely ignored.
It's used only for internal experimental updates.

```tsx
interface Props {
  children: ReactNode;
}

const ExampleComponent = ({ children }: Props) => {
  return <div>{children}</div>;
};

const Example = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ExampleComponent>This is a string</ExampleComponent>

      <ExampleComponent>{100}</ExampleComponent>

      <ExampleComponent>
        <ExampleComponent />
      </ExampleComponent>
    </div>
  )
}
```
Because we used `ReactNode`, the children can be anything within JSX.
